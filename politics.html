    <h2>üåç What This Page Is About</h2>
    <p>
      OpenMuffler isn't just a technical project ‚Äî it's also a political one. We're navigating legal ambiguities, challenging closed systems, and advocating for open access to knowledge and tools. This page documents those efforts and the struggles that come with them.

    <h2>‚öñÔ∏è Legal & Regulatory Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      As we explore ideas that intersect with automotive systems, emissions control, or digital rights, we encounter a patchwork of laws, regulations, and manufacturer restrictions. Some technologies we explore bump up against repair limitations, proprietary interfaces, or gray areas in environmental policy.

    <h2>üîí Resistance from Closed Systems</h2>
    <p>
      Many companies don't want you to modify or understand the tech you own. OpenMuffler supports the Right to Repair and aims to reverse engineer responsibly ‚Äî without promoting misuse or bypassing safeguards. But pushing for openness often draws pushback.
